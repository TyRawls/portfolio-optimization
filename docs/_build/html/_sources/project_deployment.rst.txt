Project Deployment
==================
There are two implementations for this project. One utilizes cloud storage, while the other relies on local storage.

    Before settings up this project, install Python 3.8 or later; support for Python 3.7 and earlier is deprecated for some libraries in this project.

   This setup is for MAC OS only. I will be providing setup instructions for Windows OS in a later update
