Project Setup
=============
There are two implementations for this project. One utilizes local storage, while the other relies on cloud storage.

.. note::

   This setup is designed to be compatible with the Apple MacBook (M2 Pro chip) running macOS Sonoma 14.3.1 and Python 3.11.4. 
   Initially, it includes only the cloud storage setup, with the local setup planned for a future version. As of now, it 
   has not undergone testing on Windows OS devices.
